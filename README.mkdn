-------------------

Sykobot is developed on GNU/Linux, for UNIX. It should also work on any Linux distro or OSX wich has installed the dependencies of sykobot. 
If you run sykobot on a platform not listed above please e-mail me. So i can add the platform to our list.

* [Sheeple][1]
* html-entities
* cl-irc
* cl-pprce
* bordeaux-threads
* drakma
* cl-store
* cl-json

For development
* sbcl or ccl
* slime

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
First look in the package your package manager for any dependency in the list above and install it.


The rest of the dependencies can be installed with [clbuild][4] ( note you will need to install darcs )
	darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/clbuild	
	extract it
	cd clbuild
	chmod +x clbuild
	./clbuild check  ( this checks for dependency's, they are: cvs , svn,  wget , darcs)

Now you can install all the dependencies with clbuild ( If clbuild asks you too install some dependencies , just return yes )

	./clbuild install html-entities
	./clbuild install cl-irc
	./clbuild install cl-pprce
	./clbuild install bodeaux-threads
	./clbuild install cl-store
	./clbuild install cl-json

Now we need to download sykbot and sheeple ( you will need to install git )
	git clone git://github.com/zkat/sykobot.git  
	git clone git://github.com/zkat/sheeple.git 
	cd /path/to/clbuild/systems
	ln -s /path/to/sheeple.asd
	ln -s /path/to/sykbot.asd 

For ArchLinux:
	pacman -S sbcl
	pacman -S slime-cvs
	install an text editor 

Developping in Emacs 
--------------------

Emacs configuration  ( .emacs )
	(setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/sbcl")
	(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/slime")
	(require 'slime)
	(slime-setup '(slime-fancy slime-asdf slime-sbcl-exts slime-tramp))
	(setq slime-net-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)
	(setq viper-mode t)
	(require 'viper)

	Start Emacs
	M -x slime   ( M == the alt key )
	, load-system 
	sykobot ( in the load-system prompt  )
	(in-pacakge sykobot)
	(run-bot)


Notes
-----

Sykobot is still in development , although simple bot functions work. The code can be rewritting and there is no stable branch atm. The code is on [github][2]


Features

		usage: @google <keyword> 
	

* Facts -- facts are a nice AI feature of sykobot, if someone says  "foo is bar" in an irc channel, then sykobot stores this. You can review the fact with @fact foo. Support for showing random facts is being added. Sidenote facts are overwritten all the time.
