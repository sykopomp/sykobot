* TODO [#A] Goals for new command system
  These are the requirements specified by zkat for the new command
  system to be a viable alternative to the current one.
** TODO [#A] Simple DEFCOMMAND Macro
   Sykopomp likes simple macros (who doesn't?). Also, it should be
   transparent enough that if it breaks, it'll be easy for anybody
   to understand and fix, regardless of who wrote it.
** TODO [#C] Pipes
   Pipes are neat, because they enable filters such as translation.
   Some commands such as give and echo could also be seen as pipes.
** TODO [#A] Aliases
   Aliases are one of the features requested by wizzo, and thus are a
   high-priority item. They would also help with some things like the
   command prefix.
** TODO [#B] Proper Reporting of Incorrect Syntax
   This is not present in the current system, however, it is highly
   desired by zkat. This could actually just be a hook into a
   help system.
** TODO [#C] Compatibility with Existing Commands
   The transition should be smooth. This can be worked on once there
   is something to transition _to_.
* TODO [#C] Features requested by wizzo
  I guess if we actually get these features built into sykobot, it may actually
  replace supybot as phrik's backend.
** DONE google search
** DONE quotegrabs
   Persistent quotegrabs, including being able to !grab, !rq, and !q <someone>
** DONE Aliases
   Entire commands should be aliasable, i.e. !alias wiki google site:en.wikipedia.org
** TODO Factoids
   ability to define simple persistent factoids that can be called up with just !factname
** TODO Admin access
   Maybe later? Register users, etc.
** TODO ELIZA
   *shrug*
** TODO Stability
   Don't want this fucker crashing.
** DONE Command piping
** TODO give commands

* TODO [#C] Other Features
** TODO 'log last five minutes and post to wiki...'

* TODO [#B] Bugfixes
** TODO the fact regex fails for quotes like "thewizord is a tree"
   because it reads the 'the' and then goes OH NOES  - need to fix the regex
