* TODO 0.2
** TODO Command system
*** TODO [#A] GIVE command
    This command probably requires a bit of restructuring of the way the command system works.
    Right now, commands assume their replies are simply going to be sent back to the original
    sender. GIVE breaks this, and since it's supposed to be a command, it would probably be trapped
    by the system's requirement that 'everything is a reply'.
*** TODO [#B] Fix thinko with #'build-string
    Get that to work as it should.
    Hint: output is to a stream, but maintain abstraction over IRC lib.
** TODO Other stuff
*** TODO 'log last five minutes and post to wiki...'
*** TODO Eliza
    Sort out the reflection so 'you and your family' 'my family and I'
* TODO 0.1
** TODO [#A] Listeners as sheep
   This will give good modularity for the various parts of the command
   system, and will also make aliases easier later on.
** TODO [#A] Goals for new command system
   These are the requirements specified by zkat for the new command
   system to be a viable alternative to the current one.
*** DONE [#A] Proper Reporting of Incorrect Syntax
    This is not present in the current system, however, it is highly
    desired by zkat. This could actually just be a hook into a
    help system.
    UPDATE zkat: This sort of works right now, but it can grow better as the command system
    grows and evolves. It gives some decent enough feedback for the time being, though.
**** DONE [#A] Deal correctly with bad arglists
     ie, don't send "NIL" to google search.
**** DONE [#B] Conditions for command errors
     Some good feedback. This also means in general a system for dealing with conditions (not just
     serious-error) that get caught at command-listener.  
     UPDATE zkat - Feedback is fine right now. We're catching conditions, and the conditions are
     output to channel. If we ever need specific conditions, we can just signal them within
     commands.
*** DONE [#B] Simple DEFCOMMAND Macro
    Sykopomp likes simple macros (who doesn't?). Also, it should be
    transparent enough that if it breaks, it'll be easy for anybody
    to understand and fix, regardless of who wrote it.
*** TODO [#B] Aliases
    Aliases are one of the features requested by wizzo, and thus are a
    high-priority item. They would also help with some things like the
    command prefix.
*** TODO [#C] Pipes
    Pipes are neat, because they enable filters such as translation.
    Some commands such as give and echo could also be seen as pipes.
*** DONE [#C] Compatibility with Existing Commands
    The transition should be smooth. This can be worked on once there
    is something to transition _to_.
** TODO [#B] Bugfixes
*** TODO the fact regex fails for quotes like "thewizord is a tree"
    because it reads the 'the' and then goes OH NOES  - need to fix the regex
** TODO [#C] Features requested by wizzo
   I guess if we actually get these features built into sykobot, it may actually
   replace supybot as phrik's backend.
*** DONE google search
*** DONE quotegrabs
    Persistent quotegrabs, including being able to !grab, !rq, and !q <someone>
*** DONE Factoids
    ability to define simple persistent factoids that can be called up with just !factname
*** TODO Admin access
    Maybe later? Register users, etc.
*** TODO ELIZA
    Under progress, almost DONE.
*** DONE Stability
    Don't want this fucker crashing.
    UPDATE zkat - After that horrible day when everything crashed, the bot's been ridiculously
    stable. I'm tentatively tagging this as done. There's still plenty of work to do with stability,
    but I think it's all about maturing from now on.
** DONE [#C] Other Features
*** DONE Karma
    Record karma points for each user, and allow giving positive and negative karma. People's
    ability to give karma depends on how much karma they themselves have.  UPDATE zkat: We can
    probably improve this a bit still, but it's probably not worth much effort until 0.2. I'm
    tagging this as tentatively done.
