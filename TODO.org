* TODO Finish sykobot
** TODO [#A] Deal with current command system
   We must understand the present, that we may usher in the future.
*** DONE [#A] Understand exactly what it does, how, and why.
*** DONE [#B] Figure out how to do it better.
** TODO [#A] Goals for new command system
   These are the requirements specified by zkat for the new command
   system to be a viable alternative to the current one.
*** TODO [#A] Proper Reporting of Incorrect Syntax
    This is not present in the current system, however, it is highly
    desired by zkat. This could actually just be a hook into a
    help system.
**** TODO [#A] Deal correctly with bad arglists
     ie, don't send "NIL" to google search.
**** TODO [#B] Conditions for command errors
     Some good feedback. This also means in general a system for
     dealing with conditions (not just serious-error) that get
     caught at command-listener.
*** TODO [#B] Simple DEFCOMMAND Macro
    Sykopomp likes simple macros (who doesn't?). Also, it should be
    transparent enough that if it breaks, it'll be easy for anybody
    to understand and fix, regardless of who wrote it.
*** TODO [#B] Aliases
    Aliases are one of the features requested by wizzo, and thus are a
    high-priority item. They would also help with some things like the
    command prefix.
*** TODO [#C] Pipes
    Pipes are neat, because they enable filters such as translation.
    Some commands such as give and echo could also be seen as pipes.
*** TODO [#C] Compatibility with Existing Commands
    The transition should be smooth. This can be worked on once there
    is something to transition _to_.
** TODO [#B] Bugfixes
*** TODO the fact regex fails for quotes like "thewizord is a tree"
    because it reads the 'the' and then goes OH NOES  - need to fix the regex


** TODO [#C] Features requested by wizzo
   I guess if we actually get these features built into sykobot, it may actually
   replace supybot as phrik's backend.
*** DONE google search
*** DONE quotegrabs
    Persistent quotegrabs, including being able to !grab, !rq, and !q <someone>
*** DONE Aliases
    Entire commands should be aliasable, i.e. !alias wiki google site:en.wikipedia.org
*** TODO Factoids
    ability to define simple persistent factoids that can be called up with just !factname
*** TODO Admin access
    Maybe later? Register users, etc.
*** TODO ELIZA
    *shrug*
*** TODO Stability
    Don't want this fucker crashing.
*** DONE Command piping
*** TODO give commands


** TODO [#C] Other Features
*** TODO 'log last five minutes and post to wiki...'
